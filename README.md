# Beads

The programming industry has been relying on the same IDE model for...ever. Text editors, and multiple screens. Programmers don't code on the go, because there are no IDE adapated for that. Introducing Beads

We're building a programming language and IDE that has the following characteristics: 

- Be able to code on your phone, or on your tablet. The interface is in 3D, and the code is presented as a a tree of beads. Each beads can be opened, and contains code. The program tree is manipulated by touch or mouse. 
- Be able to collaborate in real-time on a tree. The interface is sass, and several developers can collaborate in real-time on the same program. Beads is open source, but we plan to construct a startup around it. 

A program is made of beads. Each bead can be tested independently or with another group of beads. We'll be integrating unit tests directly into the system
- Visualize your program flow, isolate groups of beads (test independently) zoom in and out of your program
- There will also be a way to attach logic to each beads so that beyond testing, you can prove mathematically (through correctness proofs and such) that a chunk of your program is correct
- Beads will connect to other beads via connectors, and will be typed so that each bead will only be able to connect to valid beads
- and much more.

We expect to be demo ready in late December.
